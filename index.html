		<h3>Symbols</h3>
		<p>
			Symbols are a primitve value that you can use as unique object property
			identifiers. There are pre built in symbols as well as the ability to
			create your own symbols. We can create symbols to define object property
			identitfiers that dont exist yet and are unique. Becasue symbols return
			unique identifiers they are useful when we need to define properties on an
			object that we dont want people to have access to and overrirde
			essentially making them private. We can access built in symbols by
			defining the Symbol object and then with the dot notation accessing the
			symbol we want to use e.g. Symbol.toStringTag, Symbol.iterator. We create
			a symbol by defining a variable and then calling the 'Symbol()' method.
			The Symbol method can also take an argument to act as a debugging
			reference/identifier however this identifier has no meaning/relevance in
			the actual code of the application.
		</p>
		<h3>Iterators</h3>
		<p>
			An iterator is an object that has a 'next' method which then in turn
			returns a result of a certain structure. We can turn any object into an
			iterator by definining a next method named exactly 'next'. This 'next'
			method should return an object containing a 'value' property and a 'done'
			property which signals via a boolean whether there are more values to
			iterate over or not. This allows us to create a loopable object where we
			can loop/iterate over properties of an object. Creating custom looping
			logic like this can be useful for example when you only want to loop over
			values of one specific object property rather than using a for in or for
			of loop that loops over all object properties.
